NOTE: (COMMENTING AND UNCOMMENTING IS REQUIRED TO RUN VARIOUS PARTS OF PROJECTS. PLEASE READ "HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT")

Project Description:
	The project deals with gaining hands on knowledge on Scala programming language and along with Akka. We use Akka actors to call the Github API to get a bunch of projects and their metadeta. We then cloned two versions of a same project to find the differences between them using the Understand API.

Setting up the code:
	The code is divided into three parts: Cloning, Creating .udb files and Comparing .udb files.


How to run the project:
	-To run the project, we need to run the file: Client.scala (src/main/scala2.11/Client.scala)
	-Our project is divided into three parts: cloning Github projects, creating udbs, finding out differences
	-NOTE: The project was running out of memory and taking too long to respond when running everything at a time.
	-Thus, we need to run one part at a time:
		- At the bottom of the source code, in "Object Client", calls to part2 and part3 have been commented out.
		- PLEASE COMMENT OUT PART1 AND UNCOMMENT PART2 AFTER CLONING THE PROJECTS and comment out part 1 and 2 and uncomment part 3
			after completing part2.

Limitation:
	It takes a lot of time to clone a project. So, for the sake of simplicity, we are just cloning two projects. But it can be increased to any desired number.
